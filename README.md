# Virtual Pet Console Game

## Description
Welcome to the Virtual Pet Console Game! This is a console application written in C# using .NET 7.  

We took upon a fairly basic task in school and decided to make it more fun.  
It's designed to provide a simple and fun experience similar to a console-based Pok√©mon game.  
Take care of your virtual pet, train it, and engage in battles with other virtual pets.
